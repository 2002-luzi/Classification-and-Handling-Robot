### Introduction
Here is the project for the 17th National Intelligence Vehicle Competition.
In this competition, our robot successfully detected pictures on the ground, classified which of the 15 categories shown below the picture is.
- Airplane

And based on the three big categories, **Animals**,  **Fruits**, **Transports**, pictures were carried to three different designated places respectively.

Based on [Seekfree I.MX-RT1064 Open-source Library](https://gitee.com/seekfree/RT1064_Library) and [OpenART](https://github.com/nxp-mcuxpresso/OpenART?tab=readme-ov-file).  
Two demos can be seen [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo6jtV8wNrOjLA6P80nHEnempkIuIC3_M&si=jX61J1rNqux3kKWU).
